# GaTech Jackets Protect Jackets Tracking

Prior to the recent changes in the reporting protocols, the information provided from STAMPS has been inconsistent and inaccurate on multiple occasions. This project was created as a result for two reasons:
1. To determine reliability of data by understanding trends and also understanding changes to the numbers (i.e. total and case number discrepancies).
2. To provide case report alerts to nearly 4,500 members of Discord communities 

Since then, this codebase has changed numerous times to accomodate the changes made by STAMPS. The latest change (introducing the integration of a Tableau workbook) is the most challenging and is the reason for this rewrite. 

This change, albeit good, has also exposed other parts of Tech's infrastructure. Hence, this project will continue to operate to provide alerts but also to ensure STAMPS data reliability.

If you would like to get alerts on your own Discord server, send me an email at `aditya@diwakar.io`.
